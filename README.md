# qubos-solvers

A portfolio of solvers for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO).

## QUBO benchmarks

###	*Qbsolv* Test Cases

The first set of QUBO problem instances to benchmark the QUBO solvers are obtained from the test cases of *Qbsolv* \cite{mwbooth2017}.


##	Portfolio of QUBO Solvers 

The portfolio of QUBO solvers use the following algorithms and heuristics: 
+ [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
	- \cite{Maniezzo2010}
+ [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing)
+ [quantum annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_annealing)
